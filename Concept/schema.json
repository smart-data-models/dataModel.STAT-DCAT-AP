    "description": "A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive. The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS. Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this class.",

A preferred label is a string of UNICODE characters, such as 'romantic love' or '\u308c\u3093\u3042\u3044', in a given natural language, such as English or Japanese (written here in hiragana). The Simple Knowledge Organization System provides some basic vocabulary for associating lexical labels with resources of any type. The preferred label is useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organization system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. Formally, a preferred label is an RDF plain literal [RDF-CONCEPTS, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-RDF-CONCEPTS]. An RDF plain literal is composed of a lexical form, which is a string of UNICODE characters, and an optional language tag, which is a string of characters conforming to the syntax defined by [BCP47, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-BCP47]",
