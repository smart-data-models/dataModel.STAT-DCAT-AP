## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `inScheme[string]`: Link to the ConceptSchema in which it is defined this Concept.  . Model: [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#schemes](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#schemes)- `language[array]`: This property refers to a language of the Concept.  . Model: [https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#LinguisticSystem](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#LinguisticSystem)- `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name[string]`: The name of this item.  - `notation[string]`: A notation is a string of characters such as 'T58.5' or '303.4833' used to uniquely identify a concept within the scope of a given concept scheme. A notation is different from a lexical label in that a notation is not normally recognizable as a word or sequence of words in any natural language.  . Model: [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#notations](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#notations)- `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `prefLabel[object]`: A preferred label is a string of UNICODE characters, such as 'romantic love' or 'れんあい', in a given natural language, such as English or Japanese (written here in hiragana). The Simple Knowledge Organization System provides some basic vocabulary for associating lexical labels with resources of any type. The preferred label is useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organization system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. Formally, a preferred label is an RDF plain literal [RDF-CONCEPTS, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-RDF-CONCEPTS]. An RDF plain literal is composed of a lexical form, which is a string of UNICODE characters, and an optional language tag, which is a string of characters conforming to the syntax defined by [BCP47, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-BCP47].  . Model: [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#prefLabel](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#prefLabel)- `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type[string]`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be Concept.  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->

A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive.  
The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS.  
Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this class.  
See the [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-SKOS-PRIMER] for more examples of identifying and describing SKOS concepts.

## Example payloads    
#### Concept NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Concept in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
