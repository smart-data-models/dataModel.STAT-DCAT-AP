notesHeader:
  A SKOS concept scheme can be viewed as an aggregation of one or more SKOS concepts. Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may also be viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however, meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some flexibility in the formal data model stated below.

  The notion of a concept scheme is useful when dealing with data from an unknown source, and when dealing with data that describes two or more different knowledge organization systems.

  See the [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-SKOS-PRIMER] for more examples of identifying and describing concept schemes.
