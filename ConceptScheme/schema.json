Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may also be viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however, meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some flexibility in the formal data model stated below.",

A preferred label is a string of UNICODE characters, such as 'romantic love' or 'れんあい', in a given natural language, such as English or Japanese (written here in hiragana). The Simple Knowledge Organization System provides some basic vocabulary for associating lexical labels with resources of any type. The preferred label is useful when generating or creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organization system. These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS concept. Formally, a preferred label is an RDF plain literal [RDF-CONCEPTS, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-RDF-CONCEPTS]. An RDF plain literal is composed of a lexical form, which is a string of UNICODE characters, and an optional language tag, which is a string of characters conforming to the syntax defined by [BCP47, https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#ref-BCP47].",
