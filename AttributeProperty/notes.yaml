notesHeader:
  The Data Cube vocabulary represents the dimensions, attributes and measures as RDF properties. Each is an instance of the abstract qb:ComponentProperty (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#dfn-qb-componentproperty-1) class, which in turn has sub-classes qb:DimensionProperty, qb:AttributeProperty and qb:MeasureProperty.
  A component property encapsulates several pieces of information
    - the concept being represented (e.g. time or geographic area),
    - the nature of the component (dimension, attribute or measure) as represented by the type of the component property,
    - the type or code list used to represent the value.

  The Attribute Property represents attributes of observations in the cube, e.g. unit of measurement.
