# dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP
These data models are mapped from version 1.0.1 of the STAT-DCAT-AP standard. [Link](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/distribution/access_url/2019-05/0812e528-c428-4832-b674-d5b9c68d1b42/StatDCAT-AP_1.0.1.pdf)

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [AttributeProperty](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP/blob/master/AttributeProperty/README.md). The class of component properties which represent attributes of observations in the cube, e.g. unit of measurement.

- [Concept](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP/blob/master/Concept/README.md). A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive. The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS. Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this class.

- [ConceptScheme](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP/blob/master/ConceptScheme/README.md). A SKOS concept scheme can be viewed as an aggregation of one or more SKOS concepts. Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may also be viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however, meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some flexibility in the formal data model stated below.

- [Dataset](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP/blob/master/Dataset/README.md). Dataset Schema meeting STAT-DCAT-AP 1.0.1 specification

- [DimensionProperty](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.STAT-DCAT-AP/blob/master/DimensionProperty/README.md). The class of component properties which represent the dimensions of the cube.
